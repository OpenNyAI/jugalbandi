# JB Audio Converter

This is a package that converts audio files to bytes. It does so by two ways:

- By using **AudioSegment** module from pydub package.
- By using **ffmpeg** directly to convert the audio files to wav bytes.

To use the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

3. Once poetry is installed, go into the **jb-audio-converter** folder under the **packages** folder in the terminal and run the following commands to install the dependencies and create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
