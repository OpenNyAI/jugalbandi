# JB Legal Library

This is a package that is used in the JIVA service which does the following operations:

- Storing the act informations to cloud storage
- Searching for the acts and their sections

This package extends the Library class from the generic **jb-library** package and it is specific to the JIVA service. That is precisely why it is named **jb-legal-library**.
