# JIVA Service : Backend Service for JIVA(Judges' Intelligent Virtual Assistant)

[JIVA Service](https://jiva-service-fer6v2lowq-uc.a.run.app/library/docs) is a collection of APIs that are specific to the JIVA (Judges' Intelligent Virtual Assistant) application which provides the necessary endpoints for acts and law documents and handles their respective data. It uses FastAPI and PostgreSQL to achieve the task at hand.

_Note:_

- _The JIVA Service APIs require authentiation, so before proceeding to use the APIs, register a new user in_ [https://jiva-service-fer6v2lowq-uc.a.run.app/library/auth/docs](https://jiva-service-fer6v2lowq-uc.a.run.app/library/auth/docs) _and use the username and password for authentication._
- _An_ `Authorize` _button is there at the top corner in_ [https://jiva-service-fer6v2lowq-uc.a.run.app/library/docs](https://jiva-service-fer6v2lowq-uc.a.run.app/library/docs) _. Click on the_ `Authorize` _button and provide the username and password to login and authorize all the APIs._

# üîß 1. Installation

To use the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:OpenNyAI/jugalbandi.git
   ```

2. The code requires **Python 3.7 or higher** and the project follows poetry package system. To install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. Once poetry is installed, go into the **jb-jiva-service** folder and run the following commands to install the dependencies and create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. You will need a GCP account to store the uploaded law documents and their metadata in a bucket and to host a postgres connection to store the user data.

5. Create a file named **gcp_credentials.json** which will contain the service account credentials of your GCP account. The file will roughly have the same format mentioned below and can be stored anywhere in your machine.

   ```bash
   {
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "<your-project-id>",
     "private_key_id": "<your-private-key-id>",
     "private_key": "<your-private-key>",
     "client_email": "<your-client-email>",
     "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
     "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
     "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
     "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
     "client_x509_cert_url": "<your-client-cert-url>"
   }
   ```

6. In addition to creating gcp_credentials.json file, create another file **.env** inside the jb-jiva-service folder which will hold the development credentials and add the following variables. Update the openai_api_key, path to gcp_credentials.json file, gcp_bucket_name, your db connections and other environment variables appropriately.

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_gcp_credentials.json>

   #JIVA database env variables
   JIVA_DATABASE_NAME=<your_db_name>
   JIVA_DATABASE_USERNAME=<your_db_username>
   JIVA_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
   JIVA_DATABASE_IP=<your_db_public_ip>
   JIVA_DATABASE_PORT=5432

   # Auth env variables
   ALLOW_AUTH_ACCESS=false
   TOKEN_ALGORITHM=<your_auth_token_algorithm>
   TOKEN_JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   TOKEN_JWT_SECRET_REFRESH_KEY=<your_jwt_secret_refresh_key>
   AUTH_DATABASE_IP=<your_db_public_ip>
   AUTH_DATABASE_PORT=5432
   AUTH_DATABASE_USERNAME=<your_db_username>
   AUTH_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
   AUTH_DATABASE_NAME=<your_auth_db_name>

   # JIVA email env variables
   JIVA_EMAIL_API_KEY=<your_email_api_key>

   # JIVA url env variables
   JIVA_BASE_URL=<your_application_url>
   JIVA_SUB_URL=update-password

   # JIVA library env variables
   JIVA_LIBRARY_BUCKET=<library_bucket>
   JIVA_LIBRARY_PATH=<library_bucket_path>
   ```

7. This service uses Auth service as well as other packages such as jb-auth-token, jb-core, jb-library, jb-legal-library, jb-storage, etc. Hence their respective environment variables are also required. Please refer to their respective repositories for more information.

# üèÉüèª 2. Running

Once the above installation steps are completed, run the following command in jb-jiva-service folder of the repository in terminal

```bash
poetry run poe start
```

You can then access the APIs and their specification in [http://localhost:8080/library/docs](http://localhost:8080/library/docs) and the auth ones in [http://localhost:8080/library/auth/docs](http://localhost:8080/library/auth/docs)

# üìÉ 3. API Specification and Documentation

---

### `GET /document-info/{document_id}`

#### Request

Requires a document_id(string).

#### Successful Response
