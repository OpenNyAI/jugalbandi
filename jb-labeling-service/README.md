# Labeling Service

Labeling Service is a collection of APIs that are specific to the **Argument Generation application** which provides the necessary endpoints for handling case information and their related data. It uses FastAPI and PostgreSQL to achieve the task at hand.

# üîß 1. Installation

To use the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:OpenNyAI/jugalbandi.git
```

2. The code requires **Python 3.7 or higher** and the project follows poetry package system. If poetry is already installed, skip this step. To install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

3. Once poetry is installed, go into the **jb-labeling-service** folder in the terminal and run the following commands to install the dependencies and create a virtual environment:

```bash
  poetry install
  source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. You will need a GCP account to host a postgres connection to store the case and user details.

5. Create a file named **gcp_credentials.json** which will contain the service account credentials of your GCP account. The file will roughly have the same format mentioned below and can be stored anywhere in your machine.

   ```bash
   {
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "<your-project-id>",
     "private_key_id": "<your-private-key-id>",
     "private_key": "<your-private-key>",
     "client_email": "<your-client-email>",
     "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
     "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
     "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
     "auth_provider_x5integer9_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
     "client_x5integer9_cert_url": "<your-client-cert-url>"
   }
   ```

6. In addition to creating gcp_credentials.json file, create another file **.env** inside the jb-labeling-service folder which will hold the development credentials and add the following variables. Update the openai_api_key and your db connections appropriately.

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   LABELING_DATABASE_NAME=<your_labeling_db_name>
   LABELING_DATABASE_USERNAME=<your_db_username>
   LABELING_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
   LABELING_DATABASE_IP=<your_db_public_ip>
   LABELING_DATABASE_PORT=5432

   # Auth env variables
   TOKEN_ALGORITHM=<your_auth_token_algorithm>
   TOKEN_JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   TOKEN_JWT_SECRET_REFRESH_KEY=<your_jwt_secret_refresh_key>
   ALLOW_AUTH_ACCESS=true
   ```

# üèÉüèª 2. Running

Once the above installation steps are completed, run the following command in jb-labeling-service folder of the repository in terminal:

```bash
  poetry run poe start
```

# üìÉ 3. API Specification and Documentation

### `GET /cases`

Returns the list of cases with case id and case name assigned to the given user

#### Successful Response

```json
[
  {
    "case_id": "",
